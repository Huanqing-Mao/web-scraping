B. II alone is sufficient while I alone is not sufficient
C. Either I or II is sufficient
D. Neither I nor II is sufficient

Question:  Among M, N, D, P and K, who earns more than only the least earner among them ?

A. I alone is sufficient while II alone is not sufficient
B. II alone is sufficient while I alone is not sufficient
C. Either I or II is sufficient
D. Neither I nor II is sufficient
E. Both I and II are sufficient
",D,"From I, we have: N > M, N > P, D > N. Thus, we have: D > N > M > P or D>N> P>M.
But, from II, M earns more than P i.e. D > N > M > P. Also, since P earns less than K and N earns less than only D, so we have: D>N>K>M>P or D>N>M> K > P.
Hence, either K or M earns more than only the least earner i.e. P.
