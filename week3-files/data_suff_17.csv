A. I alone is sufficient while II alone is not sufficient
B. II alone is sufficient while I alone is not sufficient
C. Either I or II is sufficient
D. Neither I nor II is sufficient
E. Both I and II are sufficient
",E,"As given in I and II, we have: G = V = K, V + K + A = 32 and A = V + K.
Putting V + K = A in V + K + A = 32, we have: 2A = 32 or A = 16.
Thus, V + K = 16 and V = K. So, V = K = 8. Thus, G = 8.

A. I alone is sufficient while II alone is not sufficient
B. II alone is sufficient while I alone is not sufficient
C. Either I or II is sufficient
D. Neither I nor II is sufficient
E. Both I and II are sufficient
",C,"'59' means 'injurious habit' and '157' means 'stop bad habit' (from I). Thus, the common code number '5' stands for common word 'habit'. So, '9' represents 'injurious'. Hence, I is sufficient.
Also, '59' means 'injurious habit' and '839' means 'smoking is injurious'. Thus, the common code number '9' stands for common word 'injurious'. So, '5' represents 'habit'. Thus, II is also sufficient.,

B. II alone is sufficient while I alone is not sufficient
C. Either I or II is sufficient
D. Neither I nor II is sufficient
E. Both I and II are sufficient
",D,"From I, we have: S = T - 20.
From II, we have: V = T + 30.
Thus, from both I and II, we have: V + S = (T + 30) + (T - 20) = (2 T + 10).
So, to get the required amount, we need to know the amount that Tarun has.

A. I alone is sufficient while II alone is not sufficient
B. II alone is sufficient while I alone is not sufficient
C. Either I or II is sufficient
D. Neither I nor II is sufficient
E. Both I and II are sufficient
",D,"From I, we have: R>Q, R>T, S>R i.e. S>R>Q>T or S>R>T>Q.
From II, S is not the heaviest. So, P is the heaviest. Thus, we have: P > S > R > Q > T or P > S > R > T > Q. Hence, either T or Q is the lightest.
