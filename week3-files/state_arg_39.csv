Statement:  Should administrative officers be transferred after one or two years?
Arguments:

III. No. This will create a lot of administrative hassles and cause a lot of inconvenience to the officers.

A. Only II is strong
B. Only I and II are strong
C. Only II and III are strong
D. Only I and III are strong
E. All are strong
",C,"Clearly, the acquaintance of administrative officers with the local people poses no harm. So, argument I is vague. However, both II and III hold strong, because making transfers too often would neither give them enough time to settle down comfortably in a new place, nor enable them to formulate and implement their policies in toto. This would also be administratively impossible."

A. Only I is strong
B. Only I and II are strong
C. Only III is strong
D. Only I and IV are strong
E. All are strong
",C,"The use of 'only' in I makes it invalid. Also, it is the duty of the government to save its citizens from intake of any harmful products, even if they like them. So, II does not hold strong. Besides, a product must not be banned unless its harmful effects have been proved. So, III holds strong. Lastly, we cannot blindly follow the decisions taken by other countries. So, IV also does not hold."
