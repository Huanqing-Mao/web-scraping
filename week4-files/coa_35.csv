III. The known criminals should be arrested before any such season.


A. None follows
B. Only I and II follow
C. Only II and III follow
D. All follows
E. None of these
",B,"The police ought to find out the lackenings in existing security arrangements and make up for these inadequacies to strengthen security and thus prevent criminal activities in the forthcoming festival.
