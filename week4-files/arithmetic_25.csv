In a caravan, in addition to 50 hens, there are 45 goats and 8 camels with some keepers. If the total number of feet be 224 more than the number of heads in the caravan, the number of keepers is


A. 5
B. 8
C. 10
D. 15
",D,"Let number of keepers be x. Then,
Total number of feet = 2 x 50 + 4 x 45 + 4 x 8 + 2x = 2x + 312.
Total number of heads = 50 + 45 + 8 + x= 103 + x.
Therefore (2x + 312) = (103 + x) + 224   or   x = 15.

A monkey climbs 30 feet at the beginning of each hour and rests for a while when he slips back 20 feet before he again starts climbing in the beginning of the next hour. If he begins his ascent at 8.00 a.m., at what time will he first touch a flag at 120 feet from the ground?


A. 4 p.m.
B. 5 p.m.
C. 6 p.m.
D. None of these
",C,"Net ascent of the monkey in 1 hour = (30 - 20) feet = 10 feet.
So, the monkey ascends 90 feet in 9 hours i.e. till 5 p.m.
Clearly, in the next 1 hour i.e. till 6 p.m. the monkey ascends remaining 30 feet to touch the flag.

A number consists of two digits whose sum is 11. If 27 is added to the number, then the digits change their places. What is the number ?


A. 47
B. 65
C. 83
D. 92
",A,"Let the ten's digit be x. Then, unit's digit = (11 - x).
So, number = 10x + (11 - x) = 9x + 11.
Therefore (9x + 11) + 27 = 10 (11 - x) + x  9x + 38 = 110 - 9x  18x = 72  x = 4.
Thus, ten's digit = 4 and unit's digit = 7.
Hence, required number = 47.

An enterprising businessman earns an income of Re. 1 on the first day of his business. On every subsequent day, he earns an income which is just double of that made on the previous day. One the 10th day of business, his income is


A. Rs. 29
B. Rs. 210
C. Rs. 10
D. Rs. 102
",A,"Income on the first day = Re. 1.
Income on the 2nd day = Rs. (1x2) = Rs. 2^1.
Income on the 3rd day = Rs. (2^1 x 2) = Rs. 2^2 and so on. Thus, Income on the rath day = Rs. 2^n-1.
Therefore Income on the 10th day = Rs. 2^9.
