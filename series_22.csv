0,"Choose the correct alternative that will continue the same pattern and replace the question mark in the given series.

1, 2, 6, 7, 21, 22, 66, 67, ?

A. 70
B. 134
C. 201
D. 301
",C,"The pattern is + 1, x 3, + 1, x 3, + 1, x 3, + 1,.....So, missing term = 67 x 3 = 201."
1,"Choose the correct alternative that will continue the same pattern and replace the question mark in the given series.

0.5, 0.55, 0.65,0.8,?

A. 0.9
B. 0.82
C. 1
D. 0.95
",C,"The pattern is + 0.05, + 0.10, + 0.15,.....So, missing term = 0.8 + 0.20 = 1."
2,"Choose the correct alternative that will continue the same pattern and replace the question mark in the given series.

0, 2, 3, 5, 8, 10, 15, 17, 24, 26, ?

B. 30
C. 32
D. 35
",D,"The given sequence is a combination of two series :I. 0, 3, 8, 15, 24, ? and II. 2, 5, 10, 17, 26The pattern in each one of I and II is + 3, + 5, + 7, + 9, .....So, missing term = 24 + 11 = 35."
3,"Choose the correct alternative that will continue the same pattern and replace the question mark in the given series.

11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 25, ?

A. 26
B. 27
C. 29
D. 37
",C,"The pattern is + 2, + 4, + 2, + 4, .....So, missing term = 25 + 4 = 29."
