0,"In each of the following questions find out the alternative which will replace the question mark.

25 : 37 :: 49 : ?


A. 41
B. 65
C. 56
D. 60
",B,"As 25 = (5)^2 -> (5 + 1)^2 + 1 = 37.
As 49 = (7)^2 -> (7 + 1)^2 + 1 = 65.

1,"In each of the following questions find out the alternative which will replace the question mark.

K/T : 11/20 :: J/R : ?


A. 10/18
B. 11/19
C. 10/8
D. 9/10
",A,"In Eq. alphabets positions of K and T are 11 and 20 respectively.
Similarly positions of J and R are 10 and 18.

2,"In each of the following questions find out the alternative which will replace the question mark.

68 : 130 :: ? : 350


A. 220
B. 224
C. 222
D. 226
",C,"As, 68 = (4)^3 + 4
    130 = (5)^3 + 5
and 350 = (7)^3 + 7
Therefore, ? = (6)^3 + 6 = 222
"
3,"In each of the following questions find out the alternative which will replace the question mark.

61 : 121 :: ? : 337


A. 211
B. 222
C. 220
D. 240
",A,"As, 61 = (4)^3 - 3
    121 = (5)^3 - 4
and 337 = (7)^3 - 6
Therefore, ? = (6)^3 - 5 = 211
"
4,"In each of the following questions find out the alternative which will replace the question mark.

27 : 125 :: 64 : ?


A. 162
B. 216
C. 517
D. 273
",B,"27 -> 3^3; 125 -> 5^3; 64 -> 4^3
Therefore ? = 6^3 = 216.
