2,"In jurisdictions where use of headlights is optional when visibility is good, drivers who use headlights at all times are less likely to be involved in a collision than are drivers who use headlights only when visibility is poor. Yet Highway Safety Department records show that making use of headlights mandatory at all times does nothing to reduce the overall number of collisions.
hich one of the following, if true, most helps to resolve the apparent discrepancy in the information above?
. In jurisdictions where use of headlights is optional when visibility is good, one driver in four uses headlights for daytime driving in good weather.
. A law making use of headlights mandatory at all times is not especially difficult to enforce.
. Only very careful drivers use headlights when their use is not legally required.
. There are some jurisdictions in which it is illegal to use headlights when visibility is good.
. The jurisdictions where use of headlights is mandatory at all times are those where daytime visibility is frequently poor.",C,"This question asks you to resolve an apparent discrepancy in information. The discrepancy arises because the passage presents two pieces of information that are in conflict.
Response (C) is correct. If only very careful drivers use headlights when their use is not legally required, then this explains why, when headlight use is optional, those drivers are less likely to be involved in a collision than are drivers who use headlights only when visibility is poor. It stands to reason that if headlight use is made mandatory, many less-careful drivers will also use headlights. But then the group of drivers using headlights expands to include not only the very careful drivers, but drivers of all sorts—including some who are not very careful. So it is not at all surprising that the overall number of collisions is not reduced: unsafe drivers do not become more careful when forced to use headlights.
Response (A) is incorrect. Statistical information about the percentage of drivers who use headlights for daytime driving in jurisdictions where such use is optional does not help to explain why making the use of headlights mandatory does not reduce overall collisions.
Response (B) is incorrect. Rather than helping to resolve the apparent discrepancy, this statement would, if true, rule out a possible resolution. If, contrary to response (B), such a law were difficult to enforce, that might help explain why such laws do not reduce collision rates.
Response (D) is incorrect. This choice can do nothing to explain discrepancies between cases in which the use of headlights is optional when visibility is good and cases where the use of headlights is mandatory at all times. This choice introduces a third scenario that does not explain anything about either of the situations discussed in the passage.
Response (E) is incorrect. If it is true that the jurisdictions in which the use of headlights is mandatory are areas that have poor daytime visibility, one might expect the use of headlights to reduce the overall number of collisions, at least in those places. But in any case, response (E) does not explain why, in jurisdictions where use of headlights is optional, drivers who use headlights at all times are less likely to be involved in collisions. This was the most popular incorrect answer.

3,"Seven piano students—T, U, V, W, X, Y, and Z—are to give a recital, and their instructor is deciding the order in which they will perform. Each student will play exactly one piece, a piano solo. In deciding the order of performance, the instructor must observe the following restrictions:
 cannot play first or second.
 cannot play until X has played.
either T nor Y can play seventh.
ither Y or Z must play immediately after W plays.
 must play either immediately after or immediately before U plays.
uestion 2
f V plays first, which one of the following must be true?
. T plays sixth.
. X plays third.
. Z plays seventh.
. T plays immediately after Y.
. W plays immediately after X.
",C,"This question deals with an ordering relationship defined by a set of conditions concerning when seven piano students will perform. One way to approach this problem is to write down the seven recital slots in order from left to right, as illustrated below. Student V is shown in the first slot, as specified by the supposition that “V plays first”.
We can immediately fill in one of the empty slots in the recital schedule. The condition that “V must play either immediately after or immediately before U plays” tells us that U must occupy the second slot in the schedule. 
 
Since the question asks us what must be true, we can eliminate incorrect responses by showing that they could be false. Response (A) is incorrect because the statement that “T plays sixth” is not necessarily true—we can place T in one of the slots other than sixth and still meet all the conditions of the problem. One such recital schedule, with T playing third, is shown below:

This schedule can be derived as follows:
With V, U, and T in the first three positions, there are four positions left for W, X, Y, and Z.
W must come after X—because of the condition that “W cannot play until X has played”—so if X is fourth and W is fifth, this condition will be met.
This leaves two possible slots for Y and Z. Y cannot play seventh because of the condition that “Neither T nor Y can play seventh.” Suppose, then, that Y is sixth and Z is seventh.
A check will verify that this schedule meets the conditions of the problem, including the one that “Either Y or Z must play immediately after W plays.”
The schedule shown above also demonstrates that response (B) is incorrect. In it, X plays fourth, so it is not correct that the statement, “X plays third,” must be true.
Response (C), “Z plays seventh,” is the credited response. We can show Z must be seventh by demonstrating that:
all the conditions can be met with Z in the seventh slot, and
some of the conditions would be violated with Z in any slot other than seventh.
To demonstrate that Z can play seventh, you can refer to the schedule that was developed for the discussion of response (A), above. In it, Z plays seventh, and the supposition given in the question and all the conditions in the passage are met.
To demonstrate that Z cannot play in a slot other than seventh, we can attempt to find another student to play seventh. We already know that neither U nor V can play seventh. Hence, there are four remaining players: T, W, X, and Y. However, a review of the conditions shows that none of those players can play seventh:
The third condition states that “Neither T nor Y can play seventh.”
W can’t play seventh, because there must be a slot following W’s in order to meet the condition, “Either Y or Z must play immediately after W plays.” If W plays seventh, then there is no such slot left for Y or Z.
For a similar reason X can’t play seventh, because there must be a slot following X’s in order to meet the condition, “W cannot play until X has played.”
Since Z can play seventh and no other player can, then the statement that Z must play seventh is correct and (C) is the credited response.
Response (D) is incorrect because it is not necessarily true that “T plays immediately after Y.” In our discussion of response (A), we developed a schedule in which T plays third and Y plays sixth, yet all conditions are satisfied.
Response (E) is incorrect because, as shown in the schedule below, it is not necessarily true that “W plays immediately after X.” This schedule is obtained by simply reversing the order of players W and Y in the schedule we developed in the analysis of response (A).
A review will show that all of the suppositions given in the question and all the conditions in the passage are met by this schedule:

This was a difficult question, based on the number of test takers who answered it correctly when it appeared on the LSAT. The most commonly selected incorrect answer choices were (B) and (E).

.Grants are awarded in all four areas.

f a wildlife preservation grant and a youth services grant are awarded in the same quarter of a particular calendar year, then any of the following could be true that year EXCEPT:
. A medical services grant is awarded in the second quarter.
. A theater arts grant is awarded in the first quarter.
. theater arts grant is awarded in the second quarter.
. wildlife preservation grant is awarded in the fourth quarter.
. youth services grant is awarded in the third quarter.",E,"This question deals with the awarding of grants during the quarters of a calendar year. One way to approach this problem is to set up a simple table with columns representing the four quarters. Since the fifth condition in the passage states that “[a] wildlife preservation grant is awarded in the second quarter,” we know that all possible solutions for any question based on the passage must include a wildlife preservation grant awarded in the second quarter.

The particular question here begins with the added supposition that “a wildlife preservation grant and a youth services grant are awarded in the same quarter of a particular calendar year.” One possible way this could be satisfied is to have a youth services grant awarded in the second quarter in addition to the wildlife grant awarded in that quarter.

Another possibility would be to have a wildlife preservation grant and a youth services grant both being awarded in some quarter other than the second quarter. Given the condition that “[n]o grants in the same area are awarded in the same quarter or in consecutive quarters,” the only quarter in which a wildlife preservation grant could be awarded in addition to the second quarter is the fourth quarter. So the only alternative way to satisfy the added supposition is if both a wildlife preservation grant and a youth services grant are awarded in the fourth quarter.

So far, then, we’ve determined that for this question there must be a youth services grant awarded in the second quarter or the fourth quarter.
Each of the incorrect answer choices for this question is a statement that could be true. The question asks you to identify the exception; that is, you need to find the statement that cannot be true. The correct answer choice is (E), which states: “A youth services grant is awarded in the third quarter.” This could not be true without violating the third condition, which specifies that “[n]o grants in the same area are awarded in the same quarter or in consecutive quarters.” We saw above that a youth services grant must either be awarded in the second quarter or the fourth quarter. On either possibility, awarding a youth services grant in the third quarter would result in two consecutive quarters where the youth services grant is awarded.

In both cases, two youth services grants would be awarded in consecutive quarters, in violation of the third condition.
To see that each of the other answer choices could be true, it will suffice to construct a possible outcome for each one that is consistent with the supposition given in the question and the conditions in the passage. 

A quick check of the conditions shows that this satisfies all of the conditions for the problem:
A wildlife preservation grant and a youth services grant are awarded in the same quarter of a particular calendar year.
Grants are awarded in all four areas. (The table includes at least one of each of the four letters—M, T, W, and Y.)
No more than six grants are awarded. (The table contains exactly six entries.)
No grants in the same area are awarded in the same quarter or in consecutive quarters. (In the table above, only T and M are repeated, and neither repetition appears in the same or consecutive columns.)
Exactly two medical services grants are awarded. (The table contains exactly two M’s, in columns 2 and 4.)
A wildlife preservation grant is awarded in the second quarter.
Notice that in this possible outcome, a medical services grant is awarded in the second quarter (answer choice (A)) and a theater arts grant is awarded in the first quarter (answer choice (B)). So answer choices (A) and (B) are both incorrect.

A check of the conditions shows that this satisfies the supposition and all of the conditions. In this outcome, a theater arts grant is awarded in the second quarter (answer choice (C)) and a wildlife preservation grant is awarded in the fourth quarter (answer choice (D)). So answer choices (C) and (D) are also incorrect.

f P is not selected to attend the retirement dinner, then exactly how many different groups of four are there each of which would be an acceptable selection?
. one
.two
.three
.four
.five",C,"This question adds a new supposition to the original set of conditions—“P is not selected to attend the retirement dinner.” The task is to determine all of the different possible selections that are compatible with this new supposition. A compatible solution is one that violates neither the new supposition nor the original conditions.
Since the second condition states “[e]ither N or P must be selected ...,” we can infer from the new supposition (P is not selected) and the second condition (either N or P, but not both, is selected) that N is selected. And since N is selected, we know from the third condition that L is selected. In other words, every acceptable selection must include both L and N.
We are now in a good position to enumerate the groups of four which would be acceptable selections. The first condition specifies that either J or K, but not both, must be selected. So you need to consider the case where J (but not K) is selected and the case in which K (but not J) is selected. Let’s first consider the case where J (but not K) is selected. In this case, Q is not selected, since the fourth condition tells you that if K is not selected, then Q cannot be selected either. Since exactly four people must be selected, and since P, K, and Q are not selected, M, the only remaining person, must be selected. Since M’s selection does not violate any of the conditions or the new supposition, N, L, J, and M is an acceptable selection; in fact, it is the only acceptable selection when K is not selected. So far we have one acceptable selection, but we must now examine what holds in the case where K is selected.
Suppose that K is selected. In this case J is not selected, but Q may or may not be selected. If Q is selected, it is part of an acceptable selection—N, L, K, and Q. If Q is not selected, remembering that J and P are also not selected, M must be selected. This gives us our final acceptable selection—N, L, K, and M.
Thus there are exactly three different groups of four which make up acceptable selections, and (C) is the correct response.

f laundry is earlier than kitchen cleaning, then hedge trimming must be
. fifth
. fourth
. third
. second
. first",A,"This problem is concerned with determining the order in which six activities will be performed.
The first condition in the passage tells us that grocery shopping has to be immediately after hedge trimming, which we can abbreviate as follows:
1. HG
The second condition tells us that kitchen cleaning has to be earlier than grocery shopping, which we can abbreviate as follows, where “...” is used to represent “earlier than” (which means any time before, including immediately before):
2. K ... G
The third condition tells us that motorbike servicing has to be earlier than laundry, and the fourth condition tells us that motorbike servicing has to be either immediately before or immediately after jogging. These conditions can be abbreviated as follows, where the / symbol is used to represent “or”:
3. M ... L
4. MJ / JM
Notice that the information specified in these four conditions can be collapsed into two ordering statements:
I. K ... HG (first and second conditions)
II. MJ / JM ... L (third and fourth conditions)
Question 7 introduces the new supposition “laundry is earlier than kitchen cleaning”:
L ... K
This new supposition works to further collapse the ordering statements in I and II to the single statement below; that is, if L must be earlier than K, then we know that the activities must be ordered like this:
MJ / JM ... L ... K ... HG
So, with the addition of the new supposition, there are exactly two possible orderings of the six activities, differing only with respect to whether motorbike servicing is immediately before or immediately after jogging:

MJLKHG
JMLKHG

Question 7 asks what position hedge trimming must be in, given the new supposition. What we see here is that hedge trimming must be the fifth activity performed, and so answer choice (A) is correct.

hich one of the following, if substituted for the condition that motorbike servicing has to be earlier than laundry, would have the same effect in determining the order of the student’s activities?
. Laundry has to be one of the last three activities.
. Laundry has to be either immediately before or immediately after jogging.
. Jogging has to be earlier than laundry.
. Laundry has to be earlier than hedge trimming.
. Laundry has to be earlier than jogging. ",C,"This question asks you to select the condition which, if substituted for the third condition in the passage (repeated below), would have the same effect as the original condition.
Third condition: Motorbike servicing has to be earlier than laundry.
In this case, you can deduce that the correct answer choice is (C):
(C) Jogging has to be earlier than laundry.
The fourth condition in the passage tells you that motorbike servicing has to be either immediately before or immediately after jogging. That is, M and J must be ordered as a block, either MJ or JM, with respect to the other four activities. Thus, if, as the original third condition states, M has to be earlier than L, then we know that J must also be earlier than L. Conversely, if, as the new condition in answer choice (C) states, J has to be earlier than L, then we know that M must also be earlier than L. In short, the third condition and answer choice (C) have exactly the same effect. Therefore, answer choice (C) is correct.
Another way to approach this kind of question is to attempt to eliminate all of the incorrect answer choices. Under this approach, you want to rule out any answer choice that does either of the following:
rules out outcomes that the original condition allows
allows outcomes that the original condition rules out
Let’s see how this approach would enable us to eliminate answer choices (A), (B), (D), and (E).
Consider the condition presented in answer choice (A):
(A) Laundry has to be one of the last three activities.
We can first ask whether this condition would rule out outcomes that the original third condition allows. To answer this question, we must simply determine whether there is an outcome allowed by the original third condition along with the other conditions in which laundry is one of the first three activities. Here is such an outcome:

MJLKHG

Because the original third condition allows this outcome, but the condition in answer choice (A) does not, answer choice (A) cannot be correct.
Consider answer choice (B):
(B) Laundry has to be either immediately before or immediately after jogging.
Again, we want to first determine whether this new condition would rule out outcomes that the original third condition allows. To answer this question, we must simply determine whether there is at least one outcome allowed by the original third condition along with the other conditions in which laundry is neither immediately before nor immediately after jogging. Here is one such outcome:

KHGJML

This outcome, although allowed by the original third condition, would be ruled out by the alternative condition given in answer choice (B). Thus, answer choice (B) cannot be correct.
Next consider answer choice (D):
(D) Laundry has to be earlier than hedge trimming.
Again, we want to first determine whether this new condition would rule out outcomes that the original third condition allows. To answer this question, we must simply determine whether there is at least one outcome allowed by the original third condition along with the other conditions in which laundry is not earlier than hedge trimming. One such outcome was given immediately above: since L is not earlier than H in this outcome, it would be ruled out by the condition in answer choice (D). So, answer choice (D) rules out an outcome that the original third condition allows, and therefore (D) cannot be the correct answer choice.
Finally, consider answer choice (E):
(E) Laundry has to be earlier than jogging.
Again, we want to first determine whether having this new condition would rule out outcomes that are allowed when the original third condition is in place. To answer this question, we must simply determine whether there is at least one outcome allowed by the original third condition along with the other conditions in which laundry is not earlier than jogging. One such outcome was given above: since L is not earlier than J in this outcome, it would be ruled out by the condition presented in answer choice (E). So, answer choice (E) rules out an outcome that the original third condition allows, and therefore (E) cannot be the correct answer choice.
In sum, answer choices (A), (B), (D), and (E) can all be eliminated because in each case the condition is one that rules out outcomes that the original condition allows. For this particular question, there was no need to consider whether any of the options could be eliminated because they allowed outcomes that the original condition ruled out.
