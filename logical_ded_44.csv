C. Only either I or IV and either II or III follow
D. Only III and either I or IV follow
E. None of these
",D,"III is the converse of the third premise and so it holds.
Some pearls are stones. Some stones are diamonds.
Since both the premises are particular, no definite conclusion follows.
Some stones are diamonds. No diamond is a gem.
Since one premise is particular and the other negative, the conclusion must be particular negative and should not contain the middle term. So, it follows that 'Some stones are not gems'.
However, I and IV involve the extreme terms of the three premises and form a complementary pair, Thus, either I or IV follows.

IIII. All doors are ropes.

A. Only I and II follow
B. Only I, II and III follow
C. Only either I or III, and II follow
D. Only either I or III, and IV follow
E. None of these
",E,"All rods are bricks. Some bricks are ropes.
Since the middle term 'bricks' is not distributed even once in the premises, no definite conclusion follows.
Some bricks are ropes. All ropes are doors.
Since one premise is particular, the conclusion must be particular and should not contain the middle term. So, it follows that 'Some bricks are doors'. II is the converse of this conclusion and so it holds.
All rods are bricks. Some bricks are doors.
Since the middle term 'bricks' is not distributed even once in the premises, no definite conclusion follows.
However, I and III involve the extreme terms. But, since they are not contradictory, they do not form a complementary pair.
Hence, only II follows.

No fiction is novel. All novels are stories.
Since the middle term 'novels' is distributed twice in the premises, the conclusion must be particular. Since one premise is negative, the conclusion must be negative.
So, it follows that 'Some stories are not fictions'.
Hence, only I and III follow.
