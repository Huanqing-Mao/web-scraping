A. 49
B. 50
C. 51
D. 52
",D,"The pattern is + 0, + 3, + 8, + 15, ..... i.e. + (l2 - 1), + (22 - 1), + (32 - 1), + (42 - 1), .....So, missing term = 28 + (52 - 1) = 28 + 24 = 52."
1,"37. 0, 2, 8, 14, ?, 34
A. 20
B. 23
C. 24.
D. 25
",C,"The pattern is + 2, + 6, + 6, + 10, + 10,.....So, missing term = 14 + 10 = 24."
2,"38. 1, 5, 14, 30, 55, 91, ?
A. 130
B. 140
C. 150
D. 160
",B,"The pattern is + 4, + 9, + 16, + 25, + 36, ..... i.e. + 22, + 32, + 42, + 52, + 62,.....So, missing term = 91 + 72 = 91 + 49 = 140."
3,"39. In the series 10, 17, 24, 31, 38,.....which of the following will be a number of the series ?
A. 48
B. 346
C. 574
D. 1003
",B,"The given series consists of numbers each of which, on dividing by 7, leaves aremainder 3. No other number except 346 satisfies the property."
4,"40. 240, ?, 120, 40, 10, 2
A. 180
B. 240
C. 420
D. 480
",B,"The pattern is ÷ 1, ÷ 2, ÷ 3, ÷ 4, ÷ 5.So, missing term = 240 ÷ 1 = 240."
