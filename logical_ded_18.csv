0,"In each question below are given two statements followed by two conclusions numbered I and II. You have to take the given two statements to be true even if they seem to be at variance from commonly known facts. Read the conclusion and then decide which of the given conclusions logically follows from the two given statements, disregarding commonly known facts.

Statements: All tubes are handles. All cups are handles.
Conclusions:
I. All cups are tubes.
II. Some handles are not cups.

A. Only conclusion I follows
B. Only conclusion II follows
C. Either I or II follows
D. Neither I nor II follows
E. Both I and II follow
",D,"Both the premises are A type propositions. So, in either, the middle term 'handles' forming the predicate is not distributed. Since the middle term is not distributed even once in the premises, no definite conclusion follows"

Statements: No magazine is cap. All caps are cameras.
Conclusions:
I. No camera is magazine.
II. Some cameras are magazines.

A. Only conclusion I follows
B. Only conclusion II follows
C. Either I or II follows
D. Neither I nor II follows
E. Both I and II follow
",C,"As discussed above, the conclusion must be particular negative and should not contain the middle term. So, it follows that 'Some cameras are not magazines'. However, I and II involve only the extreme terms and form a complementary pair. Thus, either I or II follows."

Statements: All huts are mansions. All mansions are temples.
Conclusions:
I. Some temples are huts.
II. Some temples are mansions.

A. Only conclusion I follows
B. Only conclusion II follows
C. Either I or II follows
D. Neither I nor II follows
E. Both I and II follow
",E,"As discussed above, it follows that 'All huts are temples'. I is the converse of this conclusion and so it holds. II is the converse of the second premise and so it also holds."

Statements: Some books are tables. Some tables are mirrors.
Conclusions:
I. Some mirrors are books.
II. No book is mirror.

A. Only conclusion I follows
B. Only conclusion II follows
C. Either I or II follows
D. Neither I nor II follows
E. Both I and II follow
",C,"Since both the premises are particular no definite conclusion follows. However, I and II involve only the extreme terms and form a complementary pair. Thus, either I or II follows."
