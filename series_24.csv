0,"Choose the correct alternative that will continue the same pattern and replace the question mark in the given series.

6, 13,28,59,?

A. 111
B. 113
C. 114
D. 122
",D,"The pattern is x 2 + 1, x 2 + 2, x 2 + 3,.....So, missing term = 59 x 2 + 4 = 122."
1,"Choose the correct alternative that will continue the same pattern and replace the question mark in the given series.

4, 12, 36, 108, ?

A. 144
B. 216
C. 304
D. 324
",D,"The pattern is x 3.So, missing term = 108 x 3 = 324."
2,"Choose the correct alternative that will continue the same pattern and replace the question mark in the given series.

Which term of the series 5, 8, 11, 14,.....is 320?

A. 104th
B. 105th
C. 106th
D. 64th
",C,"Clearly, 5 + 3 = 8, 8 + 3 = 11, 11 + 3 = 14, .....So, the series is an A.P. in which a - 5 and d = 3.Let 320 be the nth term of the series.Then, 320 = 5 + (n - 1) x 3 or (n - 1) = 105 or n = 106."
3,"Choose the correct alternative that will continue the same pattern and replace the question mark in the given series.

8, 9, 8, 7, 10, 9, 6, 11, 10, ?, 12

A. 5
B. 7
C. 8
D. 11
",A,"The given sequence is a combination of three series :I. 1st, 4th, 7th, 10th terms i.e. 8, 7, 6, ?II. 2nd, 5th, 8th, 11th terms i.e. 9, 10, 11, 12III. 3rd, 6th, 9th terms i.e. 8, 9, 10 The pattern in I is - 1.So, missing term = 6 - 1 = 5."
4,"Choose the correct alternative that will continue the same pattern and replace the question mark in the given series.

3, 7, 15, ?, 63, 127

A. 30
B. 31
C. 47
D. 52
",B,"Each number in the series is one more than twice the preceding number.So, missing term = (15 x 2) + 1 = 31."
