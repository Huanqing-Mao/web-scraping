0,"Choose the correct alternative that will continue the same pattern and replace the question mark in the given series.

7, 26, 63, 124, 215, 342, ?

A. 391
B. 421
C. 481
D. 511
",D,"The terms of the given series are (2^3 - 1), (3^3 - 1), (4^3 - 1), (5^3 - 1), (6^3 - 1), (7^3 - 1),.....
So, missing term = (8^3 - 1) = (512 - 1) = 511.

1,"Choose the correct alternative that will continue the same pattern and replace the question mark in the given series.

3, 12,27,48, 75, 108,?

A. 147
B. 162
C. 183
D. 192
",A,"The terms of the given series are 3 x l^2, 3 x 2^2, 3 x 3^2, 3 x 4^2, 3 x 5^2, 3 x 6^2,.....
So, missing term = 3 x 7^2 = 3 x 49 = 147.

2,"Choose the correct alternative that will continue the same pattern and replace the question mark in the given series.

3, 7, 23, 95, ?

A. 62
B. 128
C. 479
D. 575
",C,"The pattern is x 2 + 1, x 3 + 2, x 4 + 3,.....
So, missing term = 95 x 5 + 4 = 479.

3,"Choose the correct alternative that will continue the same pattern and replace the question mark in the given series.

6, 18, 3, 21, 7, 56, ?

A. 8
B. 9
C. 63
D. 64
",A,"Each term at an even place in the series is the product of its two adjacent terms.
Thus, if the missing term be x, then we have : 7 x x = 56 or x = 56 ÃƒÂ· 7 = 8.

4,"Choose the correct alternative that will continue the same pattern and replace the question mark in the given series.

4, 9, 25, ?, 121, 169, 289, 361

A. 49
B. 64
C. 81
D. 87
",A,"The given series consists of squares of consecutive prime numbers
i.e. 2^2, 3^2, 5^2,.....,
11^2, 13^2, 17^2, 19^2.
So, missing term = 7^2 = 49.
