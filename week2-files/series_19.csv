0,"Choose the correct alternative that will continue the same pattern and replace the question mark in the given series.
2,3,8,27, 112,?
A. 226
B. 339
C. 452
D. 565
",D,"The pattern is x 1 + 1, x 2 + 2, x 3 + 3, x 4 + 4,.....So, missing term = 112 x 5 + 5 = 565."
1,"Choose the correct alternative that will continue the same pattern and replace the question mark in the given series.
6, 17, 39, 72, ?
A. 83
B. 94
C. 116
D. 127
",C,"The pattern is + 11, + 22, + 33, .....So, missing term = 72 + 44 = 116."
2,"Choose the correct alternative that will continue the same pattern and replace the question mark in the given series.
20, 20, 19, 16, 17, 13, 14, 11, ?, ?
A. 10, 10
B. 10, 11
C. 13, 14
D. 13, 16
",A,"Let the missing terms of the series be x1 and x2.Thus, the sequence 20, 20, 19, 16, 17, 13, 14, 11, xv x2 is a combination of two series :I. 20, 19, 17, 14, x1 and II. 20, 16, 13, 11, x2The pattern in I is - 1, - 2, - 3,......So, missing term, x1 = 14 - 4 = 10.The pattern in II is - 4, - 3, - 2,......So, missing term, x2 = 11 - 1 = 10."
3,"Choose the correct alternative that will continue the same pattern and replace the question mark in the given series.
24, 60, 120, 210, ?
A. 300
B. 336
C. 420
D. 525
",B,"The pattern is + 36, + 60, + 90,.....i.e. + [6 x (6 + 0)], + [6 x (6 + 4)], + [6 x (6 + 9)],...So, missing term = 210 + [6 x (6 + 15)] = 210 + 126 = 336."
4,"Choose the correct alternative that will continue the same pattern and replace the question mark in the given series.
625, 5, 125, 25, 25, ?, 5
A. 5
B. 25
C. 125
D. 625
",C,"The given sequence is a combination of two series :I. 625, 125, 25, 5 and II. 5, 25, ?The pattern in I is รท 5, while that in II is x 5. So, missing term = 25 x 5 = 125."
