0,"Choose the correct alternative that will continue the same pattern and replace the question mark in the given series.

1, 1, 2, 6, 24, ?, 720

A. 100
B. 104
C. 108
D. 120
",D,"The pattern is x 1, x 2, x 3, x 4,.....So, missing term = 24 x 5 = 120."
1,"Choose the correct alternative that will continue the same pattern and replace the question mark in the given series.

2, 15, 4, 12, 6, 7, ?, ?

A. 8, 8
B. 8, 0
C. 3, 8
D. None of these
",B,"Let the missing terms of the series be x1 and x2.Thus, the sequence 2, 15, 4, 12, 6, 7, x1 x2 is a combination of two series :I. 2, 4, 6, x1 and II. 15, 12, 7, x2I consists of consecutive even numbers.So, missing term, x1 = 8.The pattern in II is - 3, - 5,......So, missing term, x2 = 7 - 7 = 0."
2,"Choose the correct alternative that will continue the same pattern and replace the question mark in the given series.

4832, 5840, 6848, ?

A. 7815
B. 7846
C. 7856
D. 7887
",C,"The pattern is + 1008.So, missing term - 6848 + 1008 = 7856."
3,"Choose the correct alternative that will continue the same pattern and replace the question mark in the given series.

5824, 5242, ?, 4247, 3823

A. 4467
B. 4718
C. 4856
D. 5164
",B,"Each term in the series is obtained by subtracting from the preceding term the numberformed by the first three digits of the preceding term.So, missing term = 5242 - 524 = 4718."
4,"Choose the correct alternative that will continue the same pattern and replace the question mark in the given series.

2, 8, 16, 128, ?

A. 2042
B. 2046
C. 2048
D. 2056
",C,"Each term in the series, except the first two terms, is the product of the preceding two terms.So, missing term = 16 x 128 = 2048."
