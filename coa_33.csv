Statement:  Lack of coordination between the University, its colleges and various authorities has resulted in students ousted from one college seeking migration to another.
Courses of Action:
I. If a student is ousted from a college, the information should be sent to all the other colleges of the University
II. The admissions to all the colleges of the University should be handled by the University directly.
III. A separate section should be made for taking strict action against students indulging in anti-social activities.

B. Only II follows
C. Only III follows
D. Only I and III follow
E. Only II and III follow
",A,"Clearly, the issue is not so big as to allot all powers of admissions to colleges, to the University only. So, II does not follow. The problem can be solved by circulating the information of the ousted students to all the colleges so as to ensure that such students do not get admission elsewhere also. This might prove useful in rectifying such students. So, I follows while III does not."
