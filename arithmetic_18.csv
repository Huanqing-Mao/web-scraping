Ravi's brother is 3 years senior to him. His father was 28 years of age when his sister was born while his mother was 26 years of age when he was born.

A. 32 years, 23 years
B. 32 years, 29 years
C. 35 years, 29 years
D. 35 years, 33 years
",A,"When Ravi's brother was born, let Ravi's father's age = x years and mother's age = y years.
Then, sister's age = (x - 28) years. So, x - 28 = 4   or   x = 32.
Ravi's age = (y - 26) years. Age of Ravi's brother = (y - 26 + 3) years = (y - 23) years.
Now, when Ravi's brother was born, his age = 0 i.e. y - 23 = 0   or   y = 23.
